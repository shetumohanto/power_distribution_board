# Arduino Based Electrical Power Distribution Board for Home Appliances

This project can provide safety against overcurrent, overvoltage, undervoltage to household appliances that insure the safety of the expensive equipment. The circuit response very fast with the fault occur in the load or supply and with simple code using same circuit current and voltage rating for protection can also be varied. This project was tested up to 6.5amp with 1300W power delivery and it worked fluently as described and designed. In future IoT can be integrated with the existed circuit and frequency protection can also be added with a minor modification in the code.
